Alright, today was very challenging and I learned a lot and I'm just going to make some notes.

A lot of challenges getting clear on gameplay. A lot of challenges around settling on framework and system. 

I have a severe weakness for grokking patterns and system design that I am going to need to address if I'm going to move forward in this program and be of use to this project.

I learned a lot about GAME LOOPS, and strived hard at the end of the night to find conceptual clarity about the way we are transporting and transforming the game state through each frame of the game loop.
